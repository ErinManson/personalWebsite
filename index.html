    <p>Hello and welcome to my website! I'm a fourth year Computer Science major at Wilfrid Laurier 
      University with interests in web development, and embedded software and hardware design. I’m 
      also very interested in assisting in research regarding AI, machine learning, and cryptography. 
      Outside of school I enjoy running, travelling, and film photography. Feel free to explore the 
      additional pages to hear more about my work experience, projects, and course work. Shoot me an 
      email if you have any questions about me or the website (available on my GitHub) and connect 
      with me on LinkedIn below!</p>
    <p>I have hands on experience working with existing NLP models, fine tuning and training models, 
      and making decisions on how AI can be utilized to solve problems. My favourite classes are those 
      involving electronics, I like to see how software and hardware interact to perform tasks. I also 
      have a great interest in immerging cryptographic techniques to improve data security and 
      integrity after taking fourth year Applied Cryptography (CP420) at Laurier in the fall 2024 term. 
      I cowrote a systematic literature review as a part of my work in this course on elliptic curve 
      cryptography in vehicle security which you can read more about on my course work page. I’m eager 
      to assist in research related to any of these topics for the Spring 2025 term and would love the 
      opportunity to learn more about upcoming projects which undergraduate research assistants are 
      needed or Fall 2026 start date master’s students.<br><br><br><br><br></p>
