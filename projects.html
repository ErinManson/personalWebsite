      <div class="column">
        <p> This website is a place for me to test out all things web development. 
          I noticed there were very few courses at Laurier that taught students 
          about web development in languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so I 
          began taking the Odin Project’s crash course for web development to help 
          me learn. I first became interested in web development after the 
          Research2Slides project below where one of my classmates suggested we 
          present our final work in our software engineering class in the form of 
          a web application. After exploring web development in my free time, I 
          got this domain to showcase what I’ve learned and to continue learning 
          through various online resources outside of school.</p>

      <div class="column">
        <p>The Research2Slides web application project has been one of the most 
          enjoyable projects I’ve work on thus far. During my second year at 
          Laurier I worked on this project for a large portion of my grade in 
          CP317 (Software Engineering) alongside three of my classmates. This 
          project taught us all how to work collaboratively and how to go beyond 
          our classroom learning in an effort to solve the problem at hand. We
          were given two very broad project ideas as a starting point but really 
          made this one our own. The project’s goal was to be able to convert 
          research papers into neatly summarized slideshows ready for presentation 
          and we did just that. I worked mainly on the backend of this project 
          creating classes in Java to structure the project and make sure all of 
          the many parts worked together seamlessly. We learned to used text and 
          image stripping libraries to convert PDFs to usable formats, followed 
          by a lot of text manipulation before we were ready to send it to a LLM 
          to summarize. After the text was summarized, I worked to automate the 
          process of creating and designing the PowerPoints all within a Java 
          program as well. Before this project we all had extremely limited 
          exposure to working with AI and web development. The end product was 
          something we were all very proud of that could be used by students, 
          researchers, and professors to easily convert their work into a 
          presentable format in the future. While not currently hosted on a 
          server feel free to send me any questions you may have and explore 
          the repo on my GitHub.</p>

      <div class="column">
        <p>As a large portion of my grade in CP420 (Applied Cryptography) Fall 2024 
          term I completed a research paper alongside one of my classmates. We could 
          choose any cryptography related topic to conduct a systematic literature 
          review on; we chose to explore the applications of Elliptic Curve Cryptography 
          (ECC) in vehicle security. After learning about encryption standards like DES 
          and AES in class we wondered what new standards could be the future of security 
          and ECC definitely fits the bill. We reviewed as much research as possible that 
          discussed different applications of ECC in vehicles and VANETs as technology 
          in vehicles continues to expand rapidly. I really enjoyed this project and we 
          are in the process of getting our literature review published in the new year. 
          I would also love to participate in more research both in my classes and outside 
          of class related to cryptography or LLMs. Feel free to give the paper a quick skim 
          or read by clicking the image to the right.</p>
