          <p> I will be working on the Motoinsight team at Trader Corporation starting in January
            as a data and automation co-op student.

        <p>In the summer of 2024, I worked at ICON Office Environments which is a 
          furniture distributor located in Brantford Ontario. I mainly worked to 
          create a tool that scans government tender websites for office furniture 
          bids, then proceeds to match their compatibility with the company products 
          giving scores on how well they match. I started this project after 
          completing Hugging Face’s NLP course which taught how to fine tune and 
          train LLMs. I wrote this tool mainly using Python and learned a lot about 
          how to practically use AI to solve problems and automate processes. In this 
          position I also helped to automate the company’s marketing emails by using 
          the CRM’s API and Activepieces, I also did a number of smaller tech related 
          tasks such as setting up new PCs with the Linux operating system.

        <p>As a second year computer science major my first co-op experience was at
           Sun Life. I was very lucky to land a job at such a large company for my 
           first co-op term, this expereince gave me a crash course in corporate 
           environments and allowed me to descover what I wanted out of my future 
           co-op work terms. I worked on an actuarial team and developed tools like
            a calculator that assessed the risk of high reserve insurance products, 
            and wrote highly efficent algorithms that analyzed large amount of data 
            to draw conclusions on how policies became underfunded.</p>

        <p>When I'm not working at a co-op placement I work as a Program Instructor at some local YMCA's, instructor mostly preschool, soccer, and basketball programs. Growing up i was always involved in sports so when looking for a part time job a couple years ago I found this whihc was the perfect fit. I also have extensive volunteer experience coaching soccer which helps me in this role. I plan programs, supervise children, and work as a member of a team to keep the environment welcoming and safe. I love having a positive impact on kid's lives and getting to stay active while doing it.</p>

        <p>From playing to coaching the only logical step was to start reffing soccer as well. I absolutely love reffing soccer. Very similar to my job at the YMCA its a great fit for me as a student, helps me stay involved in the sport I grew up loving so much, and has helped me develop skills like dealing with high pressure situations, and quick decision making more than I ever could've imagined when I started at age 13. I have refereed competitions ranging from adult to young children and in recreational competitions all the way up to the provincial level.</p>
